## Project Description
This robot was originally programmed as an outreach robot for FTC team 6032 to operate with basic tele-op features such as driving. As an AP Computer Science final project, the robot was given a position tracker that uses trigonometric functions along with encoder motors to track the robot's (x, y) position. Tracking position in tele-op has not been fully accomplished but the robot can move to any point on the coordinate grid on command in autonomous mode. Code may be updated for use in 2018-19 Rover Ruckus season.
